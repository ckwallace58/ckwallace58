ðŸŒ± **Hi, I'm Chad!**

Thanks for joining me in my transition from sales to a career in business/data analysis! My background in client-facing roles (BDR, AM, AE, technical support) at SaaS orgs has taught me to quickly learn/communicate technical concepts, pivot my entire day on a dime, ingest client needs/prescribe solutions accordingly, analyze data to tell a compelling story, and to stress the "human" aspects in my business relationships above all else.

This will be my space for building out my project portfolio. Now that I've completed my "SQL Fundamentals" course on Datacamp, I'll be locating, working through, and using to build out my independent project portfolio.

While I'm working on these two projects, I'll also be beginning a course on Tableau and determining other skills needed to round out my data analyst toolset.

Each project in my repository will be filled with prompts/questions pulled from CHATGPT, my own curiosity, and the internet; as well as my thought processes behind each query, in hopes of getting interview-ready.

I'm really excited to be documenting my journey with you -- cheers!
