ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning SQL on Code Academy as part of my career transition from sales into business/data analysis career. 5 years in varying client-facing roles (BDR, AM, AE, technical support) at SaaS orgs has taught me to quickly learn/communicate technical concepts, pivot my entire day on a dime, ingest client needs/prescribe solutions accordingly, analyze data to tell a compelling story, and to stress the "human" aspects in my business relationships above all else.

This will be my space for building out my project portfolio. Now that I've completed my "SQL Fundamentals" course, I'll be beginning with analyzing baby names to practice my window functions, aggregate functions, and JOINS.

After that, I plan to move into a project using Kaggle's European Soccer database (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hugomathien/soccer), as I'm an avid football fan.  That project will be focused on practing those more advanced postgreSQL functions.  

While I'm working on these two projects, I'll also be beginning a course on Tableaau and other skills needed to round out my data analyst toolset.

Each projects' repository will be filled with prompts/questions pulled from CHATGPT, my own curiousity, and the internet; as well as my thought process behind each query, in hopes of getting interview-ready.

I'm really excited to be documenting my journey with you -- cheers!
