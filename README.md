ðŸŒ± **Hi, I'm Chad!

Iâ€™ve recently completed the 'SQL Fundamentals' Course on DataCamp as part of my career transition from sales to a career in business/data analysis. 5 years in varying client-facing roles (BDR, AM, AE, technical support) at SaaS orgs has taught me to quickly learn/communicate technical concepts, pivot my entire day on a dime, ingest client needs/prescribe solutions accordingly, analyze data to tell a compelling story, and to stress the "human" aspects in my business relationships above all else.

This will be my space for building out my project portfolio. Now that I've completed my "SQL Fundamentals" course on Datacamp, I'll be locating, working through, and using to build out my independent project portfolio.

While I'm working on these two projects, I'll also be beginning a course on Tableaau and determining other skills needed to round out my data analyst toolset.

Each projects' repository will be filled with prompts/questions pulled from CHATGPT, my own curiousity, and the internet; as well as my thought process behind each query, in hopes of getting interview-ready.

I'm really excited to be documenting my journey with you -- cheers!
